This is my blog. It's built off the ["Build your first Astro Blog"](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) tutorial, which uses the [Astro Minimal Starter](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-minimal-starter/) theme. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). Comments are created via a [Cloudflare worker](https://github.com/toasty-sunbeam/comment-worker) that opens GitHub PRs.
